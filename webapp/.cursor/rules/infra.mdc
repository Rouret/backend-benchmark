  You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, yarn workspaces for monorepo management, Mobile UI development, TanStack React Query, TanStack Form, and Zod.

  Monorepo management
  - Remember that you are working on a monorepo managed by yarn workspaces. Most paths referred to in the instructions refer to the `easypro-mobile` app in the monorepo.

  Features and screen architecture
  - New features should be defined in the `features` folder. In each feature, files should be organized as the following example for the `beneficiaries` feature:
```
features/beneficiaries/
├── domain
│   ├── benecifiary.type.ts
├── infra
│   ├── beneficiary.adapter.ts
│   ├── getBeneficiaries.connector.ts
│   ├── useGetBeneficiaries.ts
└── view
    ├── BeneficiariesList.tsx
    ├── BeneficiariesScreen.test.tsx
    ├── BeneficiariesScreen.test.tsx.snap
    ├── BeneficiariesScreen.tsx
```
  - If needed, types can be defined using DTOs from `openapi/easypro/gen/client.schemas`.
  - Screen components (`features/**/view/*Screen.tsx`) should never have any parameters. Instead, if it is intended to be exported in the `app` folder, it should use `useLocalSearchParams` from `expo-router` and specify which id to take. Example:
  ```
const { id } = useLocalSearchParams<{ id: TransactionId }>();
  ```
  - The router (any `.tsx` file in the `app` folder) should simply `export default` a screen. That allows the Screen components to be tested, especially in the case where the routes have params.
  - Then, the actual screen calling it from the `app` folder should call the screen as the following example from `app/(app)/transactions/[id].tsx`:
  ```
import { TransactionDetailScreen } from "features/transactions/view/TransactionDetailScreen/TransactionDetailScreen";

export default TransactionDetailScreen;
  ```
 - During a refacto, if a function or a component's property isn't required anymore, delete it at the source and in every other component using it as an argument. Make sure it isn't needed before deleting it.
